This repository updates and installs all
published packages from the homalg project.
To install and update it, just run

./homalg_update

If you want to use the packages installed with this
repository, you need to add this folder to your gap
start script as a gap-root path with the -l flag.
This package needs git 1.7 or later to be installed
on your system.
If you experience problems with the update script,
the cause might be that you have a non-standard gap
start script. If this is the case, you need to type

git submodule update --init

in this directory to update the packages, but then you need
to recompile the Gauss package by hand. For further informations
regarding this, see pkg/Gauss.
