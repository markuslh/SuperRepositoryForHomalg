This repository updates and installs all
published packages from the homalg project.
If you want to use the packages installed with this
repository, you need to add this folder to your gap
start script as a gap-root path with the -l flag.
Since you have installed this repository,
you already have git installed, so for updating
all repositories of the homalg project to the
latest version, run

git submodule update --init

in this folder.
If you want to have the Gauss-package compiled
after updating, run the homalg_update script in this
folder.
